# FastAPI Issue Tracker

A mini production-style REST API built with FastAPI for tracking issues. This project demonstrates core FastAPI concepts including routing, data validation with Pydantic, CRUD operations, and file-based persistence.


## Features

- Full CRUD operations for issues
- Data validation with Pydantic schemas
- UUID generation for issue IDs
- Priority levels (low, medium, high)
- Status tracking (open, in_progress, closed)
- JSON file-based storage
- Auto-generated API documentation
- Custom middleware (timing, CORS)

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## API Documentation

Once running, visit:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                  | Description          |
| ------ | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/v1/health`          | Health check         |
| GET    | `/api/v1/issues`          | Get all issues       |
| GET    | `/api/v1/issues/{id}`     | Get issue by ID      |
| POST   | `/api/v1/issues`          | Create a new issue   |
| PUT    | `/api/v1/issues/{id}`     | Update an issue      |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/issues/{id}`     | Delete an issue      |

## Request/Response Examples

### Create an Issue

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/issues \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Fix login bug",
    "description": "Users cannot log in with special characters in password",
    "priority": "high"
  }'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "title": "Fix login bug",
  "description": "Users cannot log in with special characters in password",
  "priority": "high",
  "status": "open"
}
```

### Update an Issue

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/v1/issues/{id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "in_progress"
  }'
```

## Middleware

This project includes custom middleware to demonstrate the middleware pattern in FastAPI.

### Timing Middleware

Adds an `X-Process-Time` header to all responses showing how long the request took to process:

```python
# app/middleware/timing.py
async def timing_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    start = time.perf_counter()
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["X-Process-Time"] = f"{time.perf_counter() - start:.4f}s"
    return response
```

### CORS Middleware

Enables cross-origin requests from frontend applications:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```
